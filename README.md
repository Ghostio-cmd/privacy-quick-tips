# Privacy Quick Tips by Ghostio-cmd üîí

Welcome to my personal collection of **quick, impactful tips** designed to help you boost your digital privacy and security, right now.

In a world where our data is constantly scrutinized, taking small, consistent steps can make a huge difference. This repository is my vault of practical advice ‚Äì from browser tweaks to operating system settings, and everyday habits that safeguard your digital freedom.

My goal is to share straightforward insights that you can implement without needing to be a tech guru. Let's make privacy a habit!

## How to Use These Tips

Just scroll down! I've organized the tips into clear categories. Each one is designed to be concise, offering clear instructions and explaining *why* it matters. I'll be adding more as I discover them.

## üí° Browse & Online Habits

### Enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in Your Browser
Encrypt your DNS queries to prevent your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or others from seeing which websites you're trying to visit.
* **Why it matters:** Traditional DNS queries are often unencrypted. DoH adds a layer of encryption, making your Browse more private and secure.
* **How:**
    * **Firefox:** Settings -> Search "DNS over HTTPS" -> Enable and choose a privacy-focused provider (e.g., Cloudflare, NextDNS).
    * **Chrome/Chromium:** Settings -> "Privacy and security" -> "Security" -> "Use secure DNS" -> Enable and select a provider.

### Use a Dedicated Browser for Sensitive Tasks
Keep your banking, email, and other critical accounts separate from your general Browse.
* **Why it matters:** This creates a sandboxed environment, minimizing the risk of tracking or cross-site contamination from everyday Browse.
* **How:** Choose a privacy-focused browser (like Firefox Focus or Brave) and dedicate it solely to sensitive logins.

### Regularly Clear Browser Cookies for Specific Sites
Don't clear *all* cookies if you don't want to log back into everything, but target sites that track heavily.
* **Why it matters:** Cookies can be used for persistent tracking across sessions. Clearing them limits how long sites can follow you.
* **How:** In your browser settings, look for "Site Data" or "Manage Data." You can selectively remove cookies for specific websites.

### Review and Manage Browser Extension Permissions
Extensions can be powerful, but they also often request broad permissions.
* **Why it matters:** Over-permissive extensions can track your Browse, inject ads, or even steal data. Only grant necessary permissions.
* **How:** Go to your browser's extension manager (e.g., `about:addons` in Firefox, `chrome://extensions` in Chrome). Click on each extension to review its permissions and disable any that seem excessive for its function. Consider removing extensions you don't actively use.

## üêß Operating System Hardening (Linux Focus)

### Set Up a Basic UFW Firewall
A simple firewall can block unwanted incoming connections to your system.
* **Why it matters:** It's your first line of defense against network-based attacks and helps control what communicates with your PC.
* **How:** On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw enable          # Turns on the firewall
    sudo ufw default deny incoming # Blocks all incoming connections by default
    sudo ufw allow outgoing    # Allows all outgoing connections (for your internet use)
    sudo ufw status verbose    # Check status
    ```
    *Only open ports you explicitly need, like SSH if accessing remotely.*

### Check for Unnecessary Background Services
Many Linux distros come with services running that you might not need. Disabling them reduces your attack surface.
* **Why it matters:** Unused services can consume resources and potentially expose vulnerabilities.
* **How:** Use `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service` to see running services. Research any unfamiliar ones and use `sudo systemctl disable [service-name]` and `sudo systemctl stop [service-name]` if you're sure you don't need them.

### Use Flatpaks for App Sandboxing
Install applications as Flatpaks when possible to isolate them from the rest of your system.
* **Why it matters:** Flatpaks run apps in a sandbox, limiting their access to your file system and other system resources, significantly improving privacy and security.
* **How:** Ensure Flatpak is installed (`sudo apt install flatpak`), then add Flathub (`flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`). Install apps with `flatpak install flathub [app-id]`. Review app permissions with `flatpak permissions`.

### Enable Full Disk Encryption (FDE)
Encrypt your entire hard drive to protect all your data if your device is lost or stolen.
* **Why it matters:** Without FDE, someone with physical access to your device can bypass your login and access your files. Encryption renders your data unreadable.
* **How:** Most Linux distributions offer FDE as an option during the installation process (often labeled as "Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation" or similar with LUKS). It's crucial to set this up *during* installation.

## üîê App & Account Security

### Implement Unique Passwords with a Manager
Never reuse passwords. Use a strong, unique password for every single account.
* **Why it matters:** If one service is breached, your other accounts remain secure. Password managers make this easy.
* **How:** Choose a reputable **password manager** (like Bitwarden, Proton Pass, or KeePassXC) and use it to generate and store complex, unique passwords for all your online services.

### Review App Permissions Regularly
Even privacy-focused apps might request permissions you don't want to grant.
* **Why it matters:** Apps can collect data or perform actions based on the permissions you grant them. Regularly checking helps ensure they only have necessary access.
* **How:** On Linux, for Flatpaks, use `flatpak permissions` or a GUI tool like Flatseal. For other apps, consult their settings or system-level permission managers.

### Disable Read Receipts in Messaging Apps
Control who knows when you've seen their messages.
* **Why it matters:** Read receipts give others information about your activity and availability that you might prefer to keep private.
* **How:** Most messaging apps (Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.) have an option in their privacy settings to disable read receipts. Find it and toggle it off.

### Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) Everywhere Possible
Add an extra layer of security beyond just your password.
* **Why it matters:** Even if your password is stolen, MFA prevents unauthorized access to your account without the second factor (e.g., a code from an authenticator app, a physical key).
* **How:** Look for "Security" or "Login" settings in your online accounts (email, social media, banking). Use authenticator apps (like Aegis, Authy) over SMS-based 2FA when available, as SMS can be vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.

## üóÑÔ∏è File & Data Management

### Securely Delete Sensitive Files
Don't just hit 'delete'; files often remain recoverable.
* **Why it matters:** When you "delete" a file, the operating system usually just marks the space as available, but the data itself remains until overwritten. Secure deletion ensures it's truly gone.
* **How:** Use a dedicated file shredder tool like **BleachBit** (`bleachbit` in Linux repos) or a command-line tool like `shred` (e.g., `shred -zufv [filename]`). For entire disks, consider a full disk wipe utility.

### Encrypt Sensitive Files and Folders
For individual files you want to protect, encryption adds an extra layer of security.
* **Why it matters:** Even if your system is accessed, encrypted files remain unreadable without the passphrase.
* **How:** Use tools like **GnuPG (GPG)** for individual files (`gpg -c [filename]`) or consider creating encrypted containers/vaults with tools like **VeraCrypt** for sensitive folders.

### Regularly Backup Your Data (and Encrypt Backups!)
Protect against data loss, but ensure your backups remain private.
* **Why it matters:** Data loss can happen due to hardware failure, malware, or accidental deletion. Encrypted backups ensure your sensitive information isn't exposed if the backup media falls into the wrong hands.
* **How:** Use backup solutions that offer encryption (e.g., **Duplicati**, or simply encrypt the backup drive/folder with **LUKS** or GPG before copying files). Store backups offline and in a separate physical location.
